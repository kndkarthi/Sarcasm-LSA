This is pure paranoia. What evidence do you have to support you're point of view? Why don't you actually do a little research yourself. Handgun Control Inc was founded by two victims of gun-violence.

"It doen't matter what trimester it is in. The shear fact that you are arguing over something as irrelevant as the trimester of the pregnancy means that you already understand that a decision to have an abortion is an intent to take a life.

It doesn't matter if the baby knows it or not. Even if it was conscious of it, it won't care in a second.

"the question was about whales. pay attention will you? you're right; i didn't type anything in at all. i just asked huntard to prove his claim. but in response to your propaganda piece, here's some opposing evidence. the third problem, 'as zimmer acknowledges', is that there aren’t very many early whale fossils. does that surprise you? evolutionists have probably led you to believe that the fossil evidence for whale evolution is, pardon the expression, rock-solid. but there isn’t really that much 'hard' evidence. whale evolution is mostly imaginary, or speculative at best. since whales are mammals, evolutionists imagined that a land-going mammal must have returned to the sea. at first, they imagined this without any fossil evidence. so, they went looking for fossils to support their preconceived ideas. the first hint that they were probably right came in 1983, when researcher phil gingerich found a 52-million year old skull in shallow deposits in pakistan. although fragmentary, the skull had teeth that were nearly identical with those of mesonychids and the archaeocetes. … despite the whale-like characteristics of the skull, however, pakicetus lacked two important adaptations which are present in modern whales. in living whales, the ears contain large sinuses that can be filled with blood, allowing the animal to maintain pressure while diving. modern whales also transmit sound vibrations to the inner ear using a 'fat pad', which allows them to hear directionally underwater. pakicetus lacked both of these features, indicating that it was unable to dive deeply and that it could not hear well underwater. these anatomical clues meshed well with its habitat, since the pakicetus bones were found in deposits that had been laid down at the mouth of a river on the shore of a shallow sea, where the opportunities for deep diving would be limited. although no post-cranial bones of pakicetus were found, it seemed logical to assume, from the teeth and ear structure, that the animal spent a great deal of time in shallow water looking for food, but returned to the land to rest, somewhat like a modern sea lion. … the earliest known cetacean, pakicetus, demonstrates a mixture of traits which are unique to the terrestrial mesonychids as well as marine whales, and indicates that the cetaceans are descended from the mesonychid carnivores. although we have not found any post-cranial bones from pakicetus yet, ... 5 consider what this evolutionist has just told us. first, they haven’t found any post-cranial bones of pakicetus. [since this essay was written, they have found some post-cranial bones.] post-cranial bones are bones below the skull. so, all they have found is a skull. they don’t have a single pakicetus rib. they don’t have any pakicetus vertebrae. no other bones of any kind. just a skull--and a fragmentary one at that. why do they think it came from a whale ancestor? because its teeth look like whale teeth. but when they look at the ear bones, there is nothing to indicate that it could hear underwater. the skull was found in association with other fossils that lived on the bank of a river or along the sea shore. yet it “demonstrates a mixture of traits which are unique to the terrestrial mesonychids as well as marine whales, and indicates that the cetaceans [whales] are descended from the mesonychid carnivores.” in a whale of trouble so the claim is made based only on the teeth because no other evidence supports such a conclusion. that's real complete and reliable information that justifies making such an absolute claim from. not!!! emoticonxdonno","Only some? what's this then:  hxxp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Pakicetus_(1).jpg  Replace the xx with tt in case you're wondering why I put the link up like that, it's the stupid post count thingy.",sarc

He fails to appreciate that preventing an egg from being fertilized is not at all similar to murdering a fetus which is in many cases at a minimum of up to 3 months of development.

He/she understands that what you think you want at 17 yrs. old MIGHT be very different than what you will want when you are in your 20s and in love with your potential soul mate. At that time, when the man of your dreams is real and you two actually discuss your future lives together, if you then decide to get your tubes tied and never have children, he will be confident that your decision is rational and based on a mutual decision with your spouse. See the difference? To make that decision now could and probably would be greatly regretted since most men you meet in your 20s who fall in love with you will desire to have children with you one day. Very few men would choose to marry a woman who could never give them natural children. In fact, I can say with confidence that to make such a permanent decision without including the man you will fall in love with and want to marry one day is probably the most selfish decision a woman could make.

Without question my largest beef with God would have to be the fact that according to the Bible you need to believe in God in some fashion or another in order to make it into heaven. The reason this is my beef with him is because it is much more difficult to believe in him when you are born in India than if you are born in the US or Europe. The Indian culture is that of Hinduism and a mix of other religions unlike that of the US and Europe which is primarily Christian. That means being born in the US or Europe gives you a better chance of making it to heaven as you are more likely to end up being a Christian and believing in God. Would the be at all fair if this were the case? My answer is plainly and simply no! It is idiotic infact. If God existed and he was perfect then almost without a doubt he would have to base getting into heaven on the actions of a person instead of the beliefs of a person to be fair. His system would not be at all perfect if being born in one place means you get into heaven while being born in another place means you don't get into heaven. Furthermore this means that he needs to take into consideration other influences on your life including whether or not your parents or community were proper places to grow up and whether or not you were ever given the proper situation in which to change your life to God's expectations. If not given any opportunities or given very few and still turning out to be a decent person should be better than if you turned out to be a decent person and were given many opportunities to end up this way. God in all his perfection would need a very complicated system to judge who gets into heaven in order for it to be fair but I just don't see spelled out in the Bible.,"Why would anyone want to get to Heaven? Archangel and people like him would be there, praying and chanting 24/7 . Thanks but no thanks!",sarc

"MEXICO CITY – Guards and officials at a prison in northern Mexico allegedly let inmates out, lent them guns and allowed them to use official vehicles to carry out drug-related killings, including the massacre of 17 people last week, prosecutors said Sunday.After carrying out the killings the inmates would return to their cells, the Attorney General's Office said in a revelation that was shocking even for a country wearied by years of drug violence and corruption.""According to witnesses, the inmates were allowed to leave with authorization of the prison director ... to carry out instructions for revenge attacks using official vehicles and using guards' weapons for executions,"" office spokesman Ricardo Najera said at a news conference.The director of the prison in Gomez Palacio in Durango state and three other officials were placed under a form of house arrest pending further investigation. No charges have yet been filed.Prosecutors said the prison-based hit squad is suspected in three mass shootings, including the July 18 attack on a party in the city of Torreon, which is near Gomez Palacio. In that incident, gunmen fired indiscriminately into a crowd of mainly young people in a rented hall, killing 17 people, including women.Police found more than 120 bullet casings at the scene, and Najera said tests matched those casings to four assault rifles assigned to guards at the prison.Similar ballistics tests linked the guns to earlier killings at two bars in Torreon, the capital of northern Coahuila state, he said. At least 16 people were killed in those attacks on Feb. 1 and May 15, local media reported.Najera blamed the killings on disputes between rival drug cartels. ""Unfortunately, the criminals also carried out cowardly killings of innocent civilians, only to return to their cells,"" he said.Coahuila and neighboring Durango are among several northern states that have seen a spike in drug-related violence that authorities attribute to a fight between the Gulf cartel and its former enforcers, known as the Zetas.Mexico has long had a problem with investigating crimes, catching criminals and convicting people. Reports estimate less than 2 percent of crimes in Mexico result in prison sentences. But Sunday's revelation suggests that even putting cartel gunmen in prison may not prevent them from continuing to commit crimes.Interior Secretary Francisco Blake said the revelation ""can only be seen as a wake-up call for authorities to address, once again, the state of deterioration in many local law enforcement institutions ... we cannot allow this kind of thing to happen again.""Also Sunday, Mexican federal police announced the arrest of an alleged leading member of a drug gang blamed in recent killings and a car-bombing in the violence-ridden border city of Ciudad Juarez, across from El Paso, Texas.Police described Luis Vazquez Barragan, 39, as a top member of La Linea gang, the enforcement arm of the Juarez cartel, saying he received orders directly from cartel boss Vicente Carrillo Fuentes.Vazquez Barragan allegedly organized payments, moved drugs and oversaw a system of safe houses in and around Ciudad Juarez.Police said he held the same rank as fugitive gang leader Juan Pablo Ledezma, though Vazquez Barragan is not named on reward or most-wanted lists published by the Attorney General's Office, as Ledezma is.La Linea has been blamed for a car bomb that killed three people July 15 in Ciudad Juarez and for two separate shootings March 13 that killed a U.S. consular employee and two other people connected to the consulate.Police did not say when they caught Vazquez Barragan, but he was allegedly in possession of about a half-kilogram (pound) of cocaine and two guns.His arrest led to a raid on a safe house where authorities detained four suspects and freed a kidnap victim.Also Sunday, the Attorney General's Office said soldiers on patrol in Ciudad Madero in the border state of Tamaulipas seized an arsenal of about three dozen guns, 17 grenades and thousands of bullets in a house.Elsewhere in Tamaulipas, police and prosecutors raided a lot full of truck-pulled tankers in the border city of Reynosa and seized two loaded with oil of a type sometimes stolen from the pipelines of the state-owned Petroleos Mexicanos. Nore than a dozen other tankers and freight containers were also seized.Mexican drug cartels have allegedly become involved in increasingly sophisticated thefts of fuel and oil from Mexico's pipelines.In the Pacific coast state of Guerrero, authorities reported Sunday they had found the bullet-ridden bodies of six men dumped in various locations, including three in or around the resort of Acapulco. Two of the dead men were identified as people kidnapped earlier in the month.","So somebody try and tell us, that with stuff like this going on, that America still needs to overhaul its gun laws to bring them more in line with those of Mexico.",sarc

"This is a statement written by someone who obviously has not read scripture. One of the most astonising ""proofs"" if you will, that the Bible is of supernatural origin, is predictive prophecy. Science cannot, as you claim, ""explain"" everything, and it has no natural explanation for the predictions made in scripture. How can science explain through statistical probablity the over 600 prophecies in Biblical writings that have come to pass? Also, how can it explain how supposedly uneducated people (uneducated in the ways of modern science) wrote about astronomy as if they knew about the universe as we do today. How could they have described the hydrological cycle as we have only come to know it recently?Ecclesiastes 1:6The wind goes toward the south,And turns around to the north;The wind whirls about continually,And comes again on its circuit.  How did they know that the earth ""hangs on nothing"" when the accepted norm of the day did not even accept that possibility?Job 26:7He stretches out the north over empty space;He hangs the earth on nothing.  How did they know that the ""vapors"" of the earth rise to create moisture, that is seeded by lightning with nitrogen and then falls as rain to fertilze the soil?Jeremiah 10:13When He utters His voice,There is a multitude of waters in the heavens:“And He causes the vapors to ascend from the ends of the earth.He makes lightning for the rain,He brings the wind out of His treasuries.”  Hydrothermal vents[4] are described in two books of the Bible written before 1400BC—more than 3,000 years before their discovery by science.Genesis 7:11In the six hundredth year of Noah's life, in the second month, the seventeenth day of the month, on that day all the fountains of the great deep were broken up, and the windows of heaven were opened.  Even though the Bible is not a scientific text book and doesn't purport to be, nowhere is it scientifically inaccurate. In addition, many of the scientific ideas you are so impressed with are nothing new to the Bible. It was speaking of these things long before modern science spoke of them.The story goes ""They (scientists) are slowly working their way to the mountain's peak painstakingly measuring and analyzing every step that they take.

"*NOTE*: THIS IS NOT FOR THE WEAK AT STOMACH :*NOTE*Just read...Dear Mommy, I am in Heaven now, sitting on Jesus' lap. He loves me and cries with me; for my heart has been broken. I so wanted to be your little girl. I don't quite understand what has happened. I was so excited when I began realizing my existance. I was in a dark, yet comfortable place. I saw I had fingers and toes. I was pretty far along in my developing, yet not near ready to leave my surroundings. I spent most of my time thinking or sleeping. Even from my earliest days, I felt a special bonding between you and me. Sometimes I heard you crying and I cried with you. Sometimes you would yell or scream, then cry. I heard Daddy yelling back. I was sad, and hoped you would be better soon. I wondered why you cried so much. One day you cried almost all of the day. I hurt for you. I couldn't imagine why you were so unhappy. That same day, the most horrible thing happened. A very mean monster came into that warm, comfortable place I was in. I was so scared, I began screaming, but you never once tried to help me. Maybe you never heard me. The monster got closer and closer as I was screaming and screaming, ""Mommy, Mommy, help me please; Mommy, help me."" Complete terror is all I felt. I screamed and screamed until I thought I couldn't anymore. Then the monster started ripping my arms off. It hurt so bad; the pain I can never explain. It didn't stop. Oh, how I begged it to stop. I screamed in horror as it ripped my leg off. Though I was in such complete pain, I was dying. I knew I would never see your face or hear you say how much you love me. I wanted to make all your tears go away. I had so many plans to make you happy. Now I couldn't; all my dreams were shattered. Though I was in utter pain and horror, I felt the pain of my heart breaking, above all. I wanted more than anything to be your daughter. No use now, for I was dying a painful death. I could only imagine the terrible things that they had done to you. I wanted to tell you that I love you before I was gone, but I didn't know the words you could understand. And soon, I no longer had the breath to say them; I was dead.I felt myself rising. I was being carried by a huge angel into a big beautiful place. I was still crying, but the physical pain was gone. The angel took me to Jesus and set me on His lap. He said He loved me, and He was my Father. Then I was happy. I asked Him what the thing was that killed me. He answered, ""Abortion. I am sorry, my child; for I know how it feels."" I don't know what abortion is; I guess that's the name of the monster. I'm writing to say that I love you and to tell you how much I wanted to be your little girl. I tried very hard to live. I wanted to live. I had the will, but I couldn't; the monster was too powerful. It sucked my arms and legs off and finally got all of me. It was impossible to live. I just wanted you to know I tried to stay with you. I didn't want to die. Also, Mommy, please watch out for that abortion monster. Mommy, I love you and I would hate for you to go through the kind of pain I did. Please be careful.

"'white guilt is the biggest flaw in the american psyche', says dr. david yeagley, comanche indian source: comanche_patriot —————————— white pride and white guilt today in the united states and most of the white world, as soon as a white child begins his formal education, he is implicitly told that he should feel guilt for the crimes of his ancestors. guilt for finding, conquering, enslaving, and killing off non-whites around the globe ... and littering in the process. this guilt stems not from his own crimes, but from the supposed crimes of other (dead) people of the same race. but the child is never encouraged to take pride in the amazing achievements of his race. more: white pride and white guilt —————————— white guilt, obamamania, and the reality of race supporting obama for president, like supporting colin powell a decade ago, is seen by many whites as the ultimate in white guilt repellent. i don't recall ever meeting any white person who personally felt guilty for the troubles of african-americans. but i've known many whites who want to loudly blame other whites for black difficulties. more: vdare.com: 01/02/07 - white guilt, obamania, and the reality of race —————————— white guilt = black power white guilt is best understood as a vacuum of moral authority. whites live with this vacuum despite the fact that they may not feel a trace of personal guilt over past oppression of blacks. whites simply come to a place with blacks where they feel no authority to speak or judge and where they sense a great risk of being seen as racist. one terrible feature is that it means whites lack the authority to say what they see when looking at blacks and black problems. political correctness is what whites have the authority to say about blacks, no matter what they see. it is a language of severely limited authority, of euphemisms that steer whites around associations with racism. the muteness that white guilt imposes on whites undergirds black power. it lets blacks live inside the silence of whites, and have our weaknesses be unutterable by whites even as they are plainly visible. messrs. jackson and sharpton are enforcers of white silence. and when whites are silent, black mediocrity is no deterrent to black advancement. everywhere that minorities press institutions today as groups, there is an erosion of excellence. the reason for this is that white guilt allows institutions to respond only with deference – deferring to the greater moral authority of minorities by lowering standards, and remaining mute to minority mediocrity, to save the institution from the racist label. so whites have made it socially virtuous to defer and stand aside as institutions erode. the public schools are all but devastated, universities are stunted by ideology, corporations are more unctuous than churches, the media are more unctuous yet, and american politicians – of left and right – speak in barren clichés about all of this when they speak at all. more: white guilt = black power —————————— white guilt...myth or reality? shana attends a big 12 school and is always seeing white girls her age or younger propositioned by black men who get offended if rebuffed. she personally knows of one girl who had her entire social life ruined by a black man who called her a racist at a party because she would not be alone with him. 'he said something like, 'xxxx, you just won't be wit' me 'cause i be black'.' a hush settled over the crowd and a bunch of people looked at her like she was a pariah. the girl ended up going back home when all of her dormmates started harassing her for being a 'bigot'. white guilt is when a white person feels sorry for a person of color to such a point that they sacrifice their own rights, and often their own self-respect in a futile hope that somehow their action will atone for the real or imagined sins of their ancestors. arabs had slaves. as long as the slave was not muslim it was legal. arabs were even the organizers of the african slave trade to the west. yet there is no arab guilt over slavery. the romans had their entire economy powered by slaves. and often their own people were slaves. yet there is no italian or roman guilt. and the ultimate irony about the american slave trade was that many african tribes made raids on other tribes and then sold their human booty to western or arabic slavers, yet there is no african guilt. why white guilt then? one of the reasons is the media. more: queen of succubi presents white guilt fact or myth? —————————— white guilt: today, tomorrow, and forever just recently, after declining a funding request from one of chicago’s numerous beggars, i heard a most peculiar thing. the man yelled at me as i walked away: “i’m sorry i’m not white.” at first i assumed he was talking to someone else; then i saw that he wasn’t. his tactic must have been an attempt to shame pedestrians into giving him more change. presumably, as the man did not look like a novice to this ancient profession, it must be a strategy that, with the exception of this occasion, works, which tells us quite a bit about the psyche of caucasian americans. more: american renaissance news: white guilt: today, tomorrow, and forever —————————— the myths behind white guilt - part 1. the slave trade one of the many weapons which our opponents use against us, and also against others of european ancestry, is often termed historical white guilt. those who hate us point accusingly to our empire, and to our involvement in the transatlantic slave trade with the implication that we, particularly the british and european americans, are uniquely guilty of crimes against other races. they believe that, by making us feel guilty about our past, we will be less inclined to object to what is done to us on behalf of our alleged 'victims'. more: the myths behind white guilt - part 1. the slave trade | national policy institute here is an accurate depiction of white guilt at work every day in north america and europe. .","Oh Blah!

"Anyone who suggests abortion is a dispute between the rights of a woman and a fetus is trying to mislead you or is negligent about the nature of abortion rights. This isn't a dispute between woman vrs fetus but instead an issue between a woman's right to abortion and the interests of a small yet powerful vocal minority who believe they can project their views upon the majority. Rights are not simply just passed out but are based upon interest…something the Supreme Court based their conclusion during Roe v Wade. In the many years that have supported abortion rights I have never found a single pro-lifer who could prove, outside their opinion and others, how a fetus has an interest in being born. Unfortunately for them, fetuses have never elected pro-lifers to speak their behalf of but instead vice-versa. The pro-life movement plays as a self-appointed representative towards fetuses despite a lack of evidence or substance as to why a fetus, at the moment of conception, has an interest in living. So the debate is just whittled down to two factions; those who believe that abortion is a right provide to women or that a minority can oppress their views upon others because it happens to offend their beliefs. Women have a right to abortion because, as a nation, we have an invested interest in keeping abortion legal for them. For nearly 70 years we know that the fruits of coercion childbirth do not payoff…they lead to the corruption of law enforcement, provide criminals another avenue of wealth, wreck death and mutilation upon desperate women, destroy the healthcare system and leave behind an underground abortion rate that is rarely addressed by those who support coercion childbirth in the first place. Fetuses are immune from having an self-interest in being born because they have never developed such feelings in the sheer majority of abortion ever performed. Their brains are often far too primitive to hold such emotions or even awareness. If the fetus is incapable of feeling outraged or offended by being aborted then what is the big deal? Considering abortion was more legal during the times of our founding fathers then today.","Tell me then, does someone who is mentally retarded have a self-interest in staying alive?

"Lack of a Natural Mechanism. Charles Darwin, in his Origin of Species, proposed Natural Selection to be the mechanism by which an original simple-celled organism could have evolved gradually into all species observed today, both plant and animal. Darwin defines evolution as ""descent with modification."" However, Natural Selection is known to be a conservative process, not a means of developing complexity from simplicity. Later, with our increased understanding of genetics, it was thought perhaps Natural Selection in conjunction with genetic mutation allowed for the development of all species from a common ancestor. However, this is theoretical and controversial, since ""beneficial"" mutations have yet to be observed. In fact, scientists have only observed harmful, ""downward"" mutations thus far. Time Constraints. Both Creationists and Evolutionists agree that if evolution is at all possible, there needs to be an excessive (if not infinite) amount of time. For much of the 20th century, it was thought evolutionists had all the time they needed. If the earth ever looked too young for certain evolutionary developments to have occurred, the age was pushed back in the textbooks. In 1905, the earth was declared to be two billion years old. By 1970, the earth was determined to be 3.5 billion years old, and by the 1990's, the earth had become 4.6 billion years old. However, Young Earth advocates have identified quite a few Young Earth chronometers in recent years. Currently, there are approximately five times more natural chronometers indicating a ""Young Earth"" than an ""Old Earth."" Each discovery is a separate ""Limiting Factor"" that places a constraint on the possible age of the earth. For example, moon drift, earth rotation speed, magnetic field decay, erosion rates, chemical influx into the oceans, ocean salinity, etc, all constrain the possible age of the earth. Each Limiting Factor is distinct. If one were successfully challenged, there is still the problem of all the rest. Furthermore, there are Limiting Factors constraining the possible age of the universe, such as spiral galaxies where they're maintaining their spiral shapes despite their centers spinning faster than their extremities.",You are incorrect when it comes to the age of the earth. All inidciation by all branches of science indicate an earth that is over 3 billion years old. (aside from the lies of the Young earth creationism.

"Within the community of Christian believers there are areas of dispute and disagreement, including the proper way to interpret Holy Scripture. While virtually all Christians take the Bible seriously and hold it to be authoritative in matters of faith and practice, the overwhelming majority do not read the Bible literally, as they would a science textbook. Many of the beloved stories found in the Bible – the Creation, Adam and Eve, Noah and the ark – convey timeless truths about God, human beings, and the proper relationship between Creator and creation expressed in the only form capable of transmitting these truths from generation to generation. Religious truth is of a different order from scientific truth. Its purpose is not to convey scientific information but to transform hearts.We the undersigned, Christian clergy from many different traditions, believe that the timeless truths of the Bible and the discoveries of modern science may comfortably coexist. We believe that the theory of evolution is a foundational scientific truth, one that has stood up to rigorous scrutiny and upon which much of human knowledge and achievement rests. To reject this truth or to treat it as “one theory among others” is to deliberately embrace scientific ignorance and transmit such ignorance to our children. We believe that among God's good gifts are human minds capable of critical thought and that the failure to fully employ this gift is a rejection of the will of our Creator. To argue that God's loving plan of salvation for humanity precludes the full employment of the God-given faculty of reason is to attempt to limit God, an act of hubris. We urge school board members to preserve the integrity of the science curriculum by affirming the teaching of the theory of evolution as a core component of human knowledge.

"O.k., lets go through your scenario. The government has been toppled and the standing army has been crushed. Somehow all Americas nuclear arms were obliterated. The invading force has successfully instituted a dictatorship and is now systematically destroying our personal freedoms. Now suppose the year is 1799 and the population rises up. The five rounds with 200 million guns, works. The population overthroughs the invading army through sheer numbers, though the price is high in terms of casualties. America is once again free and the democratic system is once again put in place.The year is 2004, the population is no longer fit and tough from working in the fields to get their own food. But each of the 400 million people has a gun, with lets say 30 rounds each. The population now has 12 billion rounds, and lets assume each round is an armour piercing bullet with long range capabilities, and lets also assume for the hell of it, that each gun is a machine gun with long-range single shot abilities and a scope (just for fun). Same situation, same invading force. The population rises up, taking along with them the few remaining rockets and bombs from the few remaining weapons caches. Lets say 2 million hand-held anti-plane missiles, 4 million anti-tank missiles and for even more fun, lets say they have a genius military leader who has somehow the ability to maintain instant contact with any unit anywhere, and is the greatest tactical mind the planet has ever know.To overthrough the standing American army the invading force must have had massive numbers of planes, tanks and naval units. First off, 4 million anti-tank weapons is not much when put against 400 million people, so you have a lot of venerable areas. Where ever the militia units try to form, they are killed by tanks, even though many of the tanks with infantry backing are destroyed the army keeps going because to over through America who has the greatest tanks in the world, you would have to have like 10-1 ratio on the American armed divisions. But, wait. Lets assume somehow the ground forces of well-organized troops and tanks is defeated by the population. Lets assume the invading army again somehow lost all its ground units, lets pretend the enemy forces had exactly 4 million tanks, and the ratio of shot-to-kill was perfect. To defeat the American army of planes you would, again, have to have massive numbers (or technology superior planes). So the population tries shooting down the planes, but the planes would usually get away because modern planes can take out a ground-based target with out ever going closer the a couple miles. But again, wait. Somehow, without losing so many troops as not to be able to defeat the massive mechanized occupying force, all planes are spotted (miles away) and shoot down by the UNTRAINED militia. The genius military leaders (who no body though to kill) work no doubt. Yet still, the population is defeated because if I remember correctly, the militia doesn't have naval units. So even if all the inland forces could be killed, the majority of costal forces would be protected by barrages from the enemy naval force (which is very large because it had to defeat the American navy, the greatest in the world technologically).But lets assume, the population just swims to the invading ships, kills the crews, and uses the ships they stole to kill the other enemy ships. Thank god for that tactical genius at the helm of the American resistance. I am actually guessing that invading force must be like 20 times bigger then America's armies for one simple reason. The only way you could defeat the American ICBMs is to have a blitzkrieg (I know my spelling sucks) like attack. Most of the ICBM silos aren't connected to the internet, mainly because the government knows the silos would be venerable to internet attack, so any rebuttal involving the virus-like disabling of the nuclear stockpile is gone.Now, you may be wondering what am I trying to say here. Well its simple, if somehow, just somehow, the entire military force of the U.S. was obliterated, it would take just one ICBM hit on the enemy's capital city to make attack impossible. Again, the blitzkrieg like attack? Even if that worked the U.S., like Russia and a few other nuclear powers, keeps stockpiles of nuclear weapons hidden underground in the invent of being taken over, and the underground stockpiles usually have several rockets with enough range to blast the heck out of the closest invading army. So it would never happen that the U.S. would be left nuclear-naked.But lets assume that happened (maybe during a really, REALLY cool party some idiot colonel peed on them, and they just fried). The genius military commander did somehow take out the entire invading force of air, ground and sea. You still have to deal with the fact that whoever invaded the U.S. probably spend several trillion doing it ( I know, that's a pretty low number for the invasion of America), and in that case most likely have satellites and long-range missiles (again lets assume somehow America's own just fell out of the sky and the invading force got even guys together to be able to take out all America's nuclear silos including the underground stockpiles which each have own guard forces of soldiers training night and day for such an event). The hugest, most glaring problem with the militia, unless every one the 400 million militia units somehow got a radio and a laptop, they would have to gather. And if they gathered in the numbers they would need to gather in, to order to defeat the large invading army, they would be taken out very easily by 1. ICBMs launched from enemy subs 2. Prominent meetings between our military genius and his supporters stopped by snipers with a 1.5 mile range and superb training and intelligence (remember those satellites) 3. all groups preparing for ""battle"" so to speak could be taken out as they are marching or driving or whatever by mortars, ambushes, rockets, infantry rushes, tank columns etc. before they knew what hit them.4. It would take a lot of planning to get 400 million people to fight, and assuming everybody has a laptop with wireless capability, they would still need satellites for the military genius in California to command units in N.Y., N.Y., and....wait America's satellites are gone and if the invading force could do that, it wouldn't be that hard to take out commercial internet satellites in geoscyhronize orbit (effectively sitting ducks). And any land based networks would be destroyed in the first few hours of insurrection. --------------------------------------------------------------------------But militia units only have guns, and they would get their butts whooped, even with massive numbers. What you are saying is only true about Napoleonic tactics, in today's modern warfare almost completely infantry-based armies are obsolete and very venerable No the afghan war is not a valid counterpoint, the terrain was different, the people are more hardened, the weapons were supplied by a military power superior to the Russians, the afghans had unlimited anti-tank reserves, had incredibly extensive cave networks in which to hide, plan and attack, only had to defeat, on the majority, other infantry battalions because of the terrain in which armoured vehicles could not cross, the Russians were under funded and their moral low, the soviets had already been beaten down by large amounts of smaller fights across the cracking Soviet Empire, china needed to be supplied with more troops as it started to look toward independence, Afghanistan is nowhere near water eliminated the possibility of naval back-up by the very crappy Russian naval forces, the afghans received help from the rest of the Arab world which would not happen with the U.S. because if an enemy can take out the U.S., it could probably take out the combined forces of Europe and North America, and, finally, the afgans didn't have nukes so they had to defend themselves with their own two hands, but america has nukes and if ever anything tryed to do what is in the above senario they would get blasted because unlike the russians in afganhistan, the americans would be defended their homeland.

"So, you think there is a God? Bad design does not equate to no design. It really is a poor argument.Much of the force of Darwin's arguments deal with bad design. I invite anyone to post any of Darwin's arguments that specifically outline his case against design because of ""bad"" design. That said, consider this, your car is said to operate at 25% fuel efficiency. One could claim then the car is 75% bad design, therefore it is not designed, and if it is, certainly not by anyone of any intelligence.Your audio CD's have Reed-Solomon error correction because the read/write process is full of errors that need correcting. Cleary this is ""bad design"" that engineers would create read/write heads that make so many errors in the first place. Same with modems and host of other devices. Clearly if in the remote chance these bad designs are evidence of design, the designers must be clueless!Poorly designed dramas have villains and heroes. Clearly a drama (even a divine drama) is poorly designed if it has villains in the story. All the characters should be Pollyanna and there should be no great tragedies on the road to a happy ending. Life and the Divine drama, like CD's and cars, are clearly not designed, or at least not designed by anyone with intelligence, because of all the bad design woven into the designs.The reason audio CD's have so many read/write errors which are corrected Reed-Solomon error correction (somewhat like us reading someone's writing and mentally correcting spelling and grammar errors) is that it is the most optimal way to get as much data on a CD as possible. The tightest packing of data implies the highest amount of errors based on the Shannon capacity theorem.The Mp3's and JPEGS are even more ""error"" prone in that they are inexact representations of the original sound or picture, but the goal was not fidelity but compactness.A similar consideration is for the 75% inefficiency for cars. The goal is for higher acceleration and agility and cost, etc., not fuel efficiency. The point is ""bad"" design, in the grand scheme of things, might not be bad design after all. The high rate of sickness and death, the eventual death of the universe as predicted by the 2nd law of thermodynamics are not evidences that the Designer is unwise, any more than the many errors in the read/write process of audio CD suggests the engineers of those devices are incompetent.Origin of Species Chapter 13:There is another and equally curious branch of the present subject; namely, the comparison not of the same part in different members of a class, but of the different parts or organs in the same individual. Most physiologists believe that the bones of the skull are homologous with that is correspond in number and in relative connexion with the elemental parts of a certain number of vertebrae. The anterior and posterior limbs in each member of the vertebrate and articulate classes are plainly homologous. We see the same law in comparing the wonderfully complex jaws and legs in crustaceans. It is familiar to almost every one, that in a flower the relative position of the sepals, petals, stamens, and pistils, as well as their intimate structure, are intelligible in the view that they consist of metamorphosed leaves, arranged in a spire. In monstrous plants, we often get direct evidence of the possibility of one organ being transformed into another; and we can actually see in embryonic crustaceans and in many other animals, and in flowers, that organs which when mature become extremely different, are at an early stage of growth exactly alike. How inexplicable are these facts on the ordinary view of creation! Why should the brain be enclosed in a box composed of such numerous and such extraordinarily shaped pieces of bone? As Owen has remarked, the benefit derived from the yielding of the separate pieces in the act of parturition of mammals, will by no means explain the same construction in the skulls of birds. Why should similar bones have been created in the formation of the wing and leg of a bat, used as they are for such totally different purposes? Why should one crustacean, which has an extremely complex mouth formed of many parts, consequently always have fewer legs; or conversely, those with many legs have simpler mouths? Why should the sepals, petals, stamens, and pistils in any individual flower, though fitted for such widely different purposes, be all constructed on the same pattern ? On the theory of natural selection, we can satisfactorily answer these questions.Homology was a pre-darwinian idea with the term coined by Owen who rather despised Darwin and his ideas.Darwin tries to argue why a Designer would not use the same for the same function. He says homology is evidence of an unwise design. The premise is a Creator wouldn't be so inefficient.But, unless one has a handle on the teleological goal, one is free to fabricate all manner of ""bad design"" arguments (for example read/write errors in audio CD's or fuel inefficient cars). The Biotic Message Theory suggest the teleological goal for biotic reality is to communicate to humans that there is one Designer and author of life, and that life could not have evolved. Like a great novel, the ""imperfections"" of biology are part of a larger plot.It is turning out, Darwin's argument from homology is a concept in crisis.","You are assuming that the TOE of evolution has remained static since Darwins time.I have to say that is false.

None of the provisions of the Constitution establish any ""natural"" rights. They recognize such rights, but the repeal of such provisions would not end such rights. Such rights were considered by many of the Framers as obvious or ""self-evident"", but they were immersed in the prevailing republican thought of the day, as expressed in the writings of Locke, Montesquieu, Rousseau, Madison, Hamilton, and others, which discussed ""natural rights"" in some detail. Others argued that at least some of the rights needed to be made explicit in the Bill of Rights to avoid having future generations with less understanding of republican theory weaken in their defense of those rights. That has turned out to have been a good idea > (2) The right to keep and bear arms is a natural right of individuals under the theory of democratic government.

"There's just enough truth in that statement to keep me from saying it's false, but if I analyze it, it will help make my point;The word ""evolution"" has such a broad meaning that it doesn't have to mean atheism, but it since it is practically the only weapon that atheists have to combat the religious worldview, that's what it often DOES mean. If it shouldn't mean it, but it is used so that it does, then that's what it actually means.Creationism means religion, but it also involves a belief in the authenticity of historical documents that have been meticulously preserved over thousands of years. That's not just religion, it's secular, observed history - something evolution doesn't have. So if a person hearing your statement doesn't consider it carefully, it's very easy to be mislead by it. It implies that ""evolution"" (the branch that declares that the book of Genesis is false) is somehow a secular, observable truth - while creationism is nothing but a religion, a superstition. Since evolution can't prove the book of Genesis (ancient history) false, and creationism does have some historical backing, they are comparable and they directly conflict.The problem is, a school teacher can make the statement you made, and it can't be legally questioned by anyone. Yet there was a case that I read about somewhere, where a sticker was placed in science textbooks advising children to study evolution ""with an open mind"", and an ACLU lawsuit ensued. Of all those likely to be mislead by your statement, it's young impressionable school children. Publicly paid school teachers misleading them with statements like that, without a full explanation (prohibited by the courts) does get an establishment of atheism started. It's what I mean when I say that when church and state are separated, atheism and state are combined. Maybe government could be neutral, if it was small. The U.S. government is no longer small.

"Brooklyn, New York (VBS.TV) -- On January 22, 2006, the New York Times reported that all foreign journalists were being banned from Pakistan's tribal areas, which has been called ""the most dangerous place in the world."" A week before that, the CIA fired missiles remotely from a Predator aircraft into the Waziristan tribal area. They were hoping to eradicate a bunch of al Qaeda operatives. Instead, they killed 18 women and children.One week before that, I arrived in Pakistan to visit Darra Adamkhel, the massive open-air market located deep in the tribal areas, where a frighteningly high percentage of Islamic holy warriors goes to buy their guns.Gaining access to the tribal areas was next to impossible. It took months of pre-planning with the consul general of Pakistan in Montreal and top officials in Peshawar. They repeatedly denied us entry because, according to them, the Pakistani Army had too many ""sensitive operations"" going on in that region. Without my personal advantage (a family friendship with the governor of the Northwest Frontier Province), we never would have gotten in.The government assigned me and my team a political agent named Naeem Afridi. He was born and raised in the tribal areas. He took care of us while we were there, and he was a godsend. You can't do anything in this part of the world without someone like Naeem.Our driver stopped at a security point just outside the town center, where we were introduced to the Frontier Agency militia, six angry-dad-looking guys with AKs and sidearms. They became our personal bodyguards, and followed us through the tight warren of gun shops and factories, barren little brick rooms where upward of 1,000 guns are manufactured every day. Most of the work is done by hand.The vendors are Pashtuns, who are basically the toughest people in the world. They comprised the majority of the mujahideen who kicked the Soviets out of Afghanistan in the late '80s.These days, the town is rumored to be completely overrun by the Taliban. They purchase the guns, then cross the border to fight the U.S. army in Afghanistan, or they drive through the mountains to the south to fight the Pakistani army.This summer, I went back to Pakistan, and found that the fuse on this powder keg has become even shorter. The Pakistani army has surged more troops into the tribal areas, attempting to eradicate the Taliban and al Qaeda. The U.S. and British troops are attempting to do the same thing on the other side of the border in Afghanistan. Meanwhile, Pakistan itself has seen violence spread to its major urban centers, where extremists have been detonating bombs and taking over police stations.But at the same time, there is a cultural explosion taking place, a vibrant art scene and metal and rock bands popping up everywhere. The whole situation has become ultra charged by the fact that there are tons of news channels operating uncensored by the insanely corrupt government.For Pakistan, it's a volatile, turbulent, and fascinating moment in time.","So...what was all that bull**** about terrorists exploiting America's ""weak gun control laws"" in order to amass arsenals of deadly weapons?It seems to me that they don't need undercover operatives to come to America, forge documents and undergo background checks just to get civilian weapons.

The only time ""channel"" becomes teleological is when something live [a human or a beaver, let's say] intententionally does the channeling. But since it is understood that mechanical forces can also 'channel', unintentional, out of simple mechanics, the word channel cannot be called teleological.

"Court: Seattle police OK to stun pregnant womanBy GENE JOHNSON ASSOCIATED PRESS WRITERSEATTLE -- Three Seattle police officers were justified when they used a stun gun on a pregnant mother who refused to sign a traffic ticket, a federal appeals court ruled Friday in a case that prompted an incredulous dissent.Malaika Brooks was driving her son to Seattle's African American Academy in 2004 when she was stopped for doing 32 mph in a school zone. She insisted it was the car in front of her that was speeding, and refused to sign the ticket because she thought she'd be admitting guilt.Rather than give her the ticket and let her go on her way, the officers decided to arrest her. One reached in, turned off her car and dropped the keys on the floor. Brooks stiffened her arms against the steering wheel and told the officers she was pregnant, but refused to get out, even after they threatened to stun her.The officers - Sgt. Steven Daman, Officer Juan Ornelas and Officer Donald Jones - then stunned her three times, in the thigh, shoulder and neck, and hauled her out of the car, laying her face-down in the street.Brooks gave birth to a healthy baby two months later, but has permanent scars from the Taser. She sued the officers for violating her constitutional rights, and U.S. District Judge Richard Jones allowed the case to continue. He declined to grant the officers immunity for performing their official duties and said Brooks' rights were clearly violated.But in a 2-1 ruling Friday, a panel of the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals disagreed. Judges Cynthia Holcomb Hall and Diarmuid F. O'Scannlain held that the officers were justified in making an arrest because Brooks was obstructing them and resisting arrest.The use of force was also justified because of the threat Brooks posed, Hall wrote: ""It seems clear that Brooks was not going to be able to harm anyone with her car at a moment's notice. Nonetheless, some threat she might retrieve the keys and drive off erratically remained, particularly given her refusal to leave the car and her state of agitation.""They also noted that the force used wasn't that serious because the Taser was in ""touch"" mode rather than ""dart"" mode, which hurts more. They reversed the lower court's opinion and held that the officers were entitled to immunity from the lawsuit.The officers' lawyers, Ted Buck and Karen Cobb, said the officers made the right decision under the circumstances they faced.""Police officers have to have the ability to compel people to obey their lawful orders,"" Buck said. That's all the court recognized today. The 9th Circuit just applied the law instead of getting caught up in the otherwise unfortunate factual circumstances.""The majority's opinion outraged Judge Marsha Berzon, who called it ""off the wall.""""I fail utterly to comprehend how my colleagues are able to conclude that it was objectively reasonable to use any force against Brooks, let alone three activations of a Taser, in response to such a trivial offense,"" she wrote.She argued that under Washington law, the officers had no authority to take Brooks into custody: Failure to sign a traffic infraction is not an arrestable offense, and it's not illegal to resist an unlawful arrest.Berzon said the majority's notion that Brooks obstructed officers was so far-fetched that even the officers themselves didn't make that legal argument. To obstruct an officer, one must obstruct the officer's official duties, and the officers' only duties in this case were to detain Brooks long enough to identify her, check for warrants, write up the citation and give it to her. Brooks' failure to sign did not interfere with those duties, she said.Furthermore, Brooks posed no apparent threat, and the officers could not have known how stunning her would affect the fetus, or whether it might prompt premature labor - another reason their actions were inexcusable, Berzon said.Brooks' lawyer, Eric Zubel, said he would ask the 9th Circuit to rehear the case.""This is outrageous - that something like this could happen to a pregnant woman, in front of an elementary school, at 8:30 in the morning, to someone who posed no threat whatsoever,"" he said.","For anti-choicers, it's just about control and power over women. They don't care about life. (Except their own.)This same mother could be a person who didn't have access to pre-natal care.

But early birds had fingered claws on those wings. It is generally true that no organ ever springs into existance completely developed where nothing existed before.

What they do is more similar to a whale in water than a bird in air. If by chance, a small animal is upsized because of a competetive advantage, and the wings are too, then it becomes a larger flying animal.",notsarc

"Hi SS. Causing trouble again? :)The cat experiment you describe cannot, unfortunately, be used to support Lamarckian inheritance, because all the animals were denied the same essential nutrients, both the parents and the developing cats in the womb. Logically, if lack of nourishment causes health problems in one generation it's inevitably going to cause the same problems in the next even without any evolution taking place. As others have pointed out, this experiment is evidence that adaptation to that restricted diet was not happening. Had the cats initially suffered and then begun to get better, this would be strong evidence that adaptation was occurring.Similarly, if you were denied Vitamin C you would develop scurvy. If a pregnant woman was denied Vitamin C - well, it hardly bears thinking about, but the fact the baby - were it to survive at all - would undoubtedly also suffer from scurvy is readily explicable by the observation that it, too, was denied Vitamin C.Now, if the baby was born with a functional Vitamin C synthesising gene, that would be compelling evidence that organisms could intelligently respond to environmental changes.",Well I'm not arguing that this is adaptation...I have never said that.. What I am saying is the environment -- in this case diet is the cause for these traits to emerge in offspring.....but like I said earlier ToE does not admit that the diet or any enviornmental variable can influence traits in offspring. Traits are dictated by genes and genes are closed off from the enviornment. This is the basic dogma of Weismann's barrier. I'm not necessarily calling this evolution....I'm just simply pointing out that acquired traits can be inherited. There is no other way to describe this other than Lamarckism. Do you disagree that The inheritance of acquired characteristics is simply changes in physiology acquired over the life of an organism that are transmitted to offspring?,notsarc

They ended up killing each other in competition for the better jobs and for leadership since nobody was willing to play the subservient menial role.

Do those here who support the freedom of choice of abortion denounce China's policies and support the freedom of choice of bearing children?There are also some areas in India where a person running for an elected office cannot have more than two children (there are obvious implications of this policy on what the makeup of the ruling government will be and how it will institute policy).

"asahi.com????????Unloaded rifle on TV triggers controversy - EnglishOTSU, Shiga Prefecture--Given this nation's strict gun control law, were police overreacting when they swooped on a TV broadcaster that had allowed a celebrity to handle a hunting rifle during a live broadcast?The Shiga prefectural police insist they were perfectly within their rights, but TV networks are outraged, citing the fact the weapon was not loaded.The incident stems from a show aired Jan. 17 by Biwako Broadcasting Co. Almost four months later, police mounted a search of the premises and confiscated a dozen items, including a script and a DVD of the show.Critics accuse the police of being overzealous and question their motives, but law enforcement officials remain unrepentant.Shiga prefectural police regard the incident, in which a hunter with a gun permit allowed TV personality Noburo Harada, 57, to momentarily handle the rifle during the show, as a serious breach of a law concerning the storage and management of firearms.So much so, in fact, that on June 12, the prefectural police referred the case to prosecutors. As a result, the hunter, aged 49, along with a 60-year-old TV producer and a 37-year-old director of the show, could face charges of violating the swords and firearms control law.Police did not pursue a case against Harada even though he briefly handled the weapon. Police argued that he did not actually ""possess"" the rifle because the hunter handed it to him in an unscripted moment during the broadcast.Police justified their search on grounds that they needed to determine if the law concerning the storage and management of firearms had been broken.The show, called ""Tokimeki Shiga'S,"" is broadcast one Saturday a month. In the show, Harada visits various locations in the prefecture as a travel guide.The program in question was set in Yogo, where Harada and other cast members were served a pot of wild boar meat. The hunter who had killed the boar appeared in the scene. He offered the unloaded weapon to Harada and asked,""Do you want to hold it?""Harada held the rifle and commented, ""It's heavy, isn't it?"" adding, ""Not everybody has a chance to hold it, right?""He held the firearm for six seconds and then gave it back.Biwako Broadcasting says the scene in which the hunter handed over the rifle was not in the script and was improvised.The TV crew decided to display the rifle on the show after the hunter told the director he had no problem with the idea at a preliminary meeting.The prefectural police began their investigation after a complaint by a viewer.The intervention by the police flabbergasted Harada and employees of other TV stations.""I never could have imagined anything like this,"" Harada, a former member of the male comedy duo Anonenone, told reporters after he was questioned by police on June 2. ""I was stunned.""Akihiko Ito, head of the TV station's programming department, said the station would cooperate with police, but defended Harada's actions.""We consulted our lawyers, and it is hard to believe that touching a rifle for about six seconds is equivalent to possessing it,"" he said.A spokesperson with a TV station based in Osaka sharply criticized police.""They should have at least asked (Biwako Broadcasting) to cooperate voluntarily,"" a spokesperson said. ""From a common sense standpoint, we cannot even comprehend what the police were thinking.""An employee at another TV station was also critical.""If we, for example, were to produce a program about a knife shop and an actor picked up a large knife, would the police investigate us, too?"" the employee asked. ""Such an overreaction would be intimidating toward people trying to do their jobs. This would ultimately undermine viewer interest in programming.""But police say they don't understand what all the fuss is about. They say the media has, by focusing on the celebrity angle, blurred the facts in the case.A senior official with the Shiga prefectural police said the real issue is not that Harada briefly held the rifle, but whether bringing the rifle to the live broadcast was appropriate in terms of ""storage and management.""An explanation for the police tactics may lie in the revised gun control law, which took effect in January.The law was tightened after a 37-year-old man in Sasebo, Nagasaki Prefecture, shot and killed two people and wounded six in December 2007. The man, known for erratic behavior, committed suicide after the shooting.The incident called into question whether existing regulations regarding gun permits and firearm storage were adequate.""I believe the hunter who handed the rifle to the actor and the TV crew lacked an awareness of the firearm's potential danger,"" another police official said.According to the National Police Agency, police can file a case against anybody if he or she, with criminal intent to kill or injure people, possesses a weapon for even a second.A case can be built based not on the length of time of possession, but on the purpose of possession, the presence of criminal intent and whether the suspect tricked or maneuvered the gun owner.The Shiga prefectural police justify the raid on the grounds that they had to find out how it was possible to bring a gun to the show.By transporting the gun to the show, the hunter may have violated the rules under which he was granted a gun permit, police asserted.They defended questioning Harada and the crew as crucial to ferreting out the real issue--did those involved in the program improperly store and manage the weapon?Takaaki Hattori, professor of media law at Rikkyo University in Tokyo, says that police went too far.""The way the police conducted their investigation is not convincing. I sense they were trying to use the media to sell the public on the revised gun control law,"" he said. ""They should have been more cautious about the exercise of power by public authorities.""But he also said the broadcaster could have been more prudent.""The TV station should consider whether it was absolutely necessary to use a gun in making the show. The gun owner may have been primarily responsible, but the broadcaster is also to blame for lacking awareness of the law.""Takaaki Matsumiya, professor of criminal law at Ritsumeikan University School of Law in Kyoto, disagrees that the TV station or the hunter were in any way culpable and lays the blame on the authorities.Citing a precedent set by the Tokyo High Court in June 1967, he said: ""The high court decided that the act of touching a handgun for dozens of seconds by a man brokering the sale of a handgun during the transfer did not constitute 'possession,'"" he said. ""There have been no precedents to alter that interpretation. Harada did not 'possess' it (during the show).""Matsumiya also defended the hunter who brought the rifle to the set.""When the precedent concludes that a person 'has no legitimate reason' for bearing and carrying a firearm, it assumes that he or she was going to do harm or ran a risk of doing harm,"" he said. ""It is obvious that was not the case under these circumstances.""(IHT/Asahi: July 2,2009)Now then, what's all this bull**** about how other industrialized nations are better off with regard to guns when compared to America? I don't see such being the case, do you? If you can't even touch a gun that somebody hands you to examine without breaking the law, that is a serious violation of human rights and everything else.How can Japan be so much better off than we are, if it's a crime for somebody to hand you a rifle to look at but not to keep; especially when it's unloaded!?",A taste of what could be our future if the left has its way.,notsarc

"Some people attempt to explain unknown causes in nature by God's direct intervention. This has been called, ""the God of the gaps."" While God could certainly intervene in the natural process (called a miracle), to make God responsible for common natural phenomena means that as each scientific discovery finds a natural explanation of what was previously attributed to God, the direct intervention of God becomes unnecessary.

"In 1927, Supreme Court Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr. declared it ""better for all the world"" if the ""manifestly unfit"" could be stopped from reproducing. ""Three generations of imbeciles are enough,"" he famously wrote in his ruling in Buck v. Bell, which affirmed the constitutionality of forced sterilization of people deemed genetically inferior. . . . in the mid-1800's . . . the British polymath Sir Francis Galton . . . introduced the idea of intelligence as an inherited trait and . . . developed a science to promote it, which he named eugenics. In America, Galton's ideas were picked up by the biologist Charles Davenport, who in 1904 established Cold Spring Harbor laboratory on Long Island as a national center for eugenics research and policy planning. . . . Davenport created a Eugenics Records Office and recruited an ambitious young high school teacher named Harry Laughlin to join him in an enormous project that sent fieldworkers across the country to identify the ""germ-plasm"" of unfit family strains so that it could be eradicated. Laughlin became an influential developer of American compulsory sterilization policy, which had officially begun in 1907 when Indiana passed a law allowing scientists to use surgical methods to eradicate the unfit . . . .He helped Congress formulate the 1924 Immigration Act, which kept out ""inferior"" people from Southern and Eastern Europe. Bruinius deftly plays up the contrast between the eugenicists' obsession with cold measurements of human value and their own messy lives, which were marked by disease and behavior that could have qualified them as unfit: Galton suffered from severe depression; Davenport had one child who was sickly and another who was apparently dyslexic; and Laughlin was afflicted with epilepsy. In America and elsewhere, enthusiasm for eugenics was broadly supported by elites. In Britain, people as varied as Winston Churchill and George Bernard Shaw embraced its goals, and there was lively debate about how much the state itself should control reproduction of individuals. Eugenic science especially appealed to Fabian socialists, who saw it as further justification for abolishing class — after all, once the playing field was level the effect of heredity could finally express itself clearly and be studied. In this country, eugenic theory and practice engaged the likes of Theodore Roosevelt, the birth control crusader Margaret Sanger and leaders of the Carnegie and Rockefeller foundations. It galvanized temperance advocates, suffragists, and liberal American churches and synagogues. Citizens enthusiastically entered ""Fitter Family"" and ""Better Baby"" contests.","From a book review of BETTER FOR ALL THE WORLD: The Secret History of Forced Sterilization and America's Quest for Racial Purity by Harry Bruinius:http://www.nytimes.com/2006/02/26/bo...w/26satel.htmlHmmm, Teddy Roosevelt, Winston Churchill, the Rockefeller foundations, millions of Americans, the State of Indiana. . . all these embraced the concept of EUGENICS.Interesting, yes?",notsarc

"i'm not exactly sure your point with this article. was it merely to show that pro-choice groups exaggerate claims? that they use emotional rhetoric to sway people to their side? trust me, you have told me nothing new. in fact, i am somewhat amused that you pointed this out, given that pro-life groups are guilty of all this and more. it said: although the thought of finding a deceased young woman with a bloody coat hanger dangling between her legs is -- to say the least -- unpleasant, powerful and emotionally charged rhetoric does not a good argument make . i almost peed myself laughing when i read this. whatever powerful, emotional images you believe pro-choice are guilty of, pro-life groups are many times worse. what is the mental image of a deceased young woman compared to the physical picture of bloody aborted fetus'? i have seen pro-life groups holding huge posters outside high-schools, and pro-life groups hold them up in front of clinics. how much do you want to bet that the fellow here would defend one while attacking the other? the article speaks of fallacies yet fails to mention the statement of 'abortion is wrong because it's murder!' that pro-life people seem very fond of. this is the exact fallacy the article mentions, using an unproven point (abortion is murder) to hold up an unproven point (abortion is wrong). i point this out not to absolve pro-choice groups of guilt, but to say: before pointing fingers, make sure your own house is in order. this entire article is also something of a strawman argument as well. the argument that illegal abortions will almost inevitably occur if abortion is banned is not a justification for legal abortions (per se). as i see it, since illegal abortions will almost inevitably occur if abortions are banned, the complaint is that pro-life people would rather see more women hurt (and yes, more women are hurt with illegal abortion than legal) than actually solve the problems with society. to ban abortion and declare the problem solved is extremely irresponsible and does nothing to help society or women.  if you would, chloe, please link to the study the article mentions about the number of illegal abortions? i’m amazed they managed to eek out numbers, given that not even the cdc has exact figures since illegal abortions were not tracked. the most compelling evidence i’ve seen looked at the birth rates for various ethnic groups the years previous to abortion being legal to the years after, corrected for various factors such as better birth control methods. they found little change in the birth rates, indicating the number of abortions most likely did not increase or decrease. yes, i know pro-choice groups mislead with stats and figures. this is nothing new, but i feel it is dishonest to point this out without acknowledging your own groups shortcomings in the same area.","Well sigma, which is more painful??

The actual gene encodes a protein of 475 amino acids that becomes a mature protein of 448 amino acids after cleavage of a signal peptide. One study was able to identify 3 common SNPs (Single Nucleotide Polymorphism) in the coding region of the gene, 2 of which result in small changes in enzyme function in European populations. The third SNP converts that locus to a stop codon and results in an enzyme that is 447 amino acids long. Thus, the enzyme has been truncated. The resulting enzyme, LPL S447X, is functional. In fact, it results in lower incidence of vascular disease and lower blood pressure. Other truncations result in non-functional enzymes.",notsarc

"To apathy:Call me crazy, but I still don't see any evolution in the peppered moths!! We had light and dark moths before the industrial revolution, we now still have light and dark moths. The only thing that has changed is the population ratio, assumably by *natural selection*. Natural selection is not proof of evolution by any means. Creationists recognise it and accept it as it goes in nicely with the creationary model. Natural selection is basically the death of a particular type of animal if they are unsuited to the environment. In a given environment (e.g. a very cold region), some (e.g. the long-haired dogs) will be more likely to survive, and so pass on their information, than others. Natural selection can favour some sets of information above others, and can eliminate some of the existing information in the population, but it can't create any new information. An example, consider the cold environment mentioned above. We take a population of both long, short and medium, haired dogs to this environment. Over time, very short time, the population will only consist of the long haired dogs as the short and medium haired dogs would freeze and be wiped out by the cold conditions. So, as a result, the population as a whole has lost the information for making short haired dogs and has not gained any new information. What did we have when we first took the dogs to the environment? Dogs (varying in hair sizes). What did we get after a short amount of time? Dogs (only the long hair size). There is no evolution occuring here, we had dogs before, dogs after. The only difference is that the gene for making short hair has been eradicated from the population by natural selection -- that is it. This is the essense of natural selection - and goes in nicely with the Biblical account of our origins, i.e. variation within a kind and that kind's have the ability to only lose information - not gain it.So even if the peppered moth case was really true, and not a fraud, it still would not be evidence for evolution as opposed to creation. Anyone who says other wise, does not really know what they are talking about unless new genetic information is somehow being added to the moth's total DNA content, i.e. their genome, in which case you might have a point.Would any creationists like to challenge anything about this article or the concept? His method appears to be good, i.e. using observations and experimental data, as well as repeatability. He is using the scientific method (in reverse as he is collecting the observations and experimental data and then will draw a conclusion based on the evidence and possibly his own bias. This is yet to be determined, however. Can you keep us informed of his progress?","Also another example put forward is a bacteria that can only sustain itself by eating Nylon. The theory goes - nylon is a recent invention therefore this bacteria must have eolved recently.What it suggests however is that a portion of an existing population would have died if not for nylon... the bug has to have nylon, or it will die.It is akin to looking at a portion of the human population who would die from heart-trouble.

"For this to be a consistent pro-choice argument, and assuming this to be a rightful interpretation and application of the 14th amendment there would be necessary conclusions. Those who hold this as an absolute belief must extend the right of a woman's right to choose the allocation of her bodily resources beyond pregnancy and into every instance of life. Therefore the pro-choice line of reasoning that says that a woman has the right to choose to abort because she does not wish do share her bodily resources can be extended to conclude also that a newborn infant can be aborted if a woman decides not to donate her bodily resource of nutrition and she has no access to formula (no other factors involved).","That is an erroneous line of reasoning because it fails to take into account the myriad of other options open to a women after birth to remove the newborn from her care without any ill effects (physically anyway). Killing in the instance of a newborn is not justified because of those other options open to her. By contrast, a pregnant woman has exactly one option open to her to remove the fetus from her care and that is abortion. I would contend that the same line of reasoning that allows for adoption can be used here, that no one must donate their resources to a dependant.Your reasoning that a woman, using the same line of reasoning that pro-choice people employ, can withhold her bodily resources ""until the newborn dies"" as if that is equal to withholding bodily resources in pregnancy is faulty.",notsarc

"Another view of this nylon-eating-bug is given...""Finally, Mr Cerutti is out of date about this new nylon digesting ability allegedly from a frame shift. New evidence shows that the ability was due to plasmids [e.g. K. Kato, et al., ?A plasmid encoding enzymes for nylon oligomer degradation: Nucleotide sequence analysis of pOAD2?, Microbiology (Reading) 141(10):2585?2590, 1995.] In fact, more than one species of bacteria have the ability, residing on plasmids. This suggests that the information probably already existed, and was just passed between different types of bacteria."" ""All that would be needed to enable an enzyme to digest nylon is a mutation causing loss of specificity in a proteolytic (protein-degrading) enzyme. This may seem surprising? How would a loss of information create a new ability? Answer: enzymes are usually tuned very precisely to only one type of molecule (the substrate). Loss of information would reduce the effectiveness of its primary function, but would enable it to degrade other substrates, too. Since both nylon and proteins are broken down by breaking amide linkages, a change in a proteolytic enzyme could also allow it to work on nylon. If this process were continued, the result would be a general enzyme with a weakly catalytic effect on the hydrolysis of too many chemicals to be useful where much selectivity is required. To put it into perspective, acids and alkalis also catalyze many hydrolysis reactions, but they also lack specificity. Indeed, an inhibitor of a protein degrading enzyme also inhibits the action of the nylon degrading enzyme""http://www.answersingenesis.org/home...e7-24-2000.aspTalkorigins gave their usual doubletalk""Whilst this particular case does not ""prove"" evolution, it is consistent with, and supportive of, the theory of biological evolution.""Why do they say this? Because it's still a bacteria. It's not like it suddenly became a large multi-cellular organism. But it might just prove that this bug was so well designed that it can cope with newer situations. One site does say that it, the bacteria, had the capability already within it of change ? not resultant in ?mutations?, but more like switching on previously dormant apparatus. http://members.tripod.com/aslodge/id89.htmOne poster on another forum summed the problem up like this..."" In order for species to advance there would have to be a net information gain, which isn't the case with nylon eating bacteria.The bacteria gained the ability to digest nylon, therefore was able to survive in a new environment. Two distinct advantagesBut, the bacteria lost its ability to survive in its old environment, eat its former diet and suffered a 98% loss in efficiency. Three disadvantages.So by taking two steps forward and three steps backward, where is the net gain?

Hitler didnt deserve to live but that does not give us the right to kill him.I agree with shooter and proud but hey heres a situation, why don't we give murderers fates to the ones most hurt by their crime, and rapists fates are decided by the ones t hey rape. They would know the best. IF the ones raped are too young such as under maybe 10 or are like seven or its a loved one and they can't seperate justice from love, then the case be decided by law. Give them the chance to live in solitary confinement, give them the chance, we can always take it away. But those killed don't get no more chances. In prison if they do kill put them in confinement. Same with the others, if they are in solitary and they succeed in killing someone else , death penalty then fine. But gang murders should be different, if someone is in jail for killing a gang member in a fight or something like that , it is murder but it isnt as open and as clear justice as it is if they shot a four year old in the head for being related to someone in an opposing gang. Then its wrong flat out, solitary or death penalty. Personally Id be for giving them death penalty for anyone who would do that.

"Your reasoning would be applicable if only one copy of the gene in question ever existed.If the chance of mutation A happening is one in a billion, and the chance of mutation B happening is also one in a billion, then the chance of them both happening together to a single gene is, as you say, beyond the realms of possibility at 1 in 1,000,000,000,000,000,000.However, we're not talking about a single gene. A population of a billion bacteria is nothing unusual, and all of them will contain the same gene. So while the odds of any individual experiencing mutation A are very low, the odds of one of them experiencing it are pretty high. The lottery works on the same principle. You probably won't win, but someone probably will.Ok, so now we have our billion bacteria, one of which possesses mutation A. However, the odds of mutation B stacking with it are still only 1 in 1,000,000,000.Now, if mutation A isn't particularly helpful, that's probably the end of the story. But if mutation A is helpful, then that bacterium will outcompete its peers for resources, and breed more readily than they do - either better in absolute terms, or better in immediate proximity, when in competition for the same resources. Either way, the proportion of the population possessing mutation A will increase until they predominate. Now there isn't just one copy of the A-mutant gene in circulation, there are about a billion, and the odds of mutation B stacking with just one of them are greatly improved. Once again, if mutation B is helpful the descendents of that bacterium will flourish and overrun the population, so that in a relatively short time (a few hundred bacterial generations) a single cell possessing neither mutation can give rise to a population of a billion all possessing not one but two billion-to-one mutations - a population ready for the next billion-to-one mutation to occur, and stack, and flourish, and so on.I hope that helps.","Well this is what i am saying. The probability of a and b in one organism i very low. And the probability of A and B in many generations is lower than just A. This is what Behe deals with in his book. One reason evolution of primates interest me more than bacteria is the the number of organisms and generations is much much lower, and the changes involved must be pretty big. It involves Real evolution as opposed to stuff like antibiotic resistance or sicke cell haemoglobin that i see more as a reversable adaption, not a developement to a permanently better/more complex state.

"As theorized, the concept of evolution is analogous to slow morphing, rather than quick abrupt changes in a species. MORPHING!, as can be done with computer graphics programs designed by intelligent beings. Evolution implies species go through a process of advantagous and purposful change -- but morphing is accomplished by unintelligent random processes, or at least that's how the story goes -- the created universe and life were random events. I have been patiently waiting for many years but to date have never seen or heard of any species morphing into another species. I am aware of genetic defects that limit species but unaware of mutations that perpetuate new species. Clearly variation within species is possible and has been observed, such as poodles and great danes, but they remain members of the same species.Mankind has thousands of years of written history and I am unaware of anyone observing species morphation(Is that a word?). Although it is approaching 200 years after Darwin hypothesised how species might have originated, we are no closer to observing a species morphing than Darwin. Humans attempt to create new species, such as breeding donkey with horses to get mules and lions with tigers to get ligers, but these ""NEW"" species are almost always born sterile and unable to perpetuate themselves. Besides observing it, the way to demonstrate evolution is to manipulate a species until it developes into a new species, but alas, then all you will have proven is directed efforts of intelligent beings create species.

So if you increased the cross sectional area of the wire then the resistance will decrease. What about a double adaptor? All it does is let the current go through two different circuits. Now if there are two light globes will they both glow half as bright? No. Why because the resistance is halved and there will be twice as much total electron flow. A lot of laws in electric circuit theory made sense to me when I imagined I was an electron going through a wire and how happy I would be going down a wire. Electrons are not happy but I still had an analogy that gave me answers so I was happy. I would have been better off being told that voltage is joules per coloumb so the voltage drop between circuits must be the same.","Again, it's not the point.

"The enumeration in the Constitution, of certain rights, shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people. Rights Retained by the PeopleAside from contending that a bill of rights was unnecessary, the Federalists responded to those opposing ratification of the Constitution because of the lack of a declaration of fundamental rights by arguing that inasmuch as it would be impossible to list all rights it would be dangerous to list some because there would be those who would seize on the absence of the omitted rights to assert that government was unrestrained as to those. 1 Madison adverted to this argument in presenting his proposed amendments to the House of Representatives. ''It has been objected also against a bill of rights, that, by enumerating particular exceptions to the grant of power, it would disparage those rights which were not placed in that enumeration; and it might follow by implication, that those rights which were not singled out, were intended to be assigned into the hands of the General Government, and were consequently insecure. This is one of the most plausible arguments I have ever heard against the admission of a bill of rights into this system; but, I conceive, that it may be guarded against. I have attempted it, as gentlemen may see by turning to the last clause of the fourth resolution.'' 2 It is clear from its text and from Madison's statement that the Amendment states but a rule of construction, making clear that a Bill of Rights might not by implication be taken to increase the powers of the national government in areas not enumerated, and that it does not contain within itself any guarantee of a right or a proscription of an infringement. 3 Recently, however, the Amendment has been construed to be positive affirmation of the existence of rights which are not enumerated but which are nonetheless protected by other provisions.",The purpose of the Bill of Rights.

Since then, we have observed fruit flies, as well as other specimens, to evolve quite rapidly, showing significant evolution in only a decade or so. More recently, however, scientists have been able to observe evolution in natural settings and have found that it can sometimes be quite rapid when environmental change is rapid.

"For obvious reasons we Christians have always been adamant supporters of civil liberties when it comes to freedom of religion. We have even managed to be consistent in this principle by not opposing the rights of Buddhists, New Agers, or even Satanists to meet, because we realize that to do so would equally undercut our own right to assemble. Perhaps the thought of undermining religious freedom sends through our minds flashes of those days when the Emperor Nero used to ignite Christians as human torches to light the streets of Rome at night. The persecutions against the early church have ingrained into our Christian consciousness the incredible value of living under a government that protects the interests of religion.But in the case of civil same-sex marriage, instead of recognizing the civil rights issue at stake here, we oppose the idea, quoting Bible verses and appealing to morals, nature, tradition, history, and the fear that Western civilization as we know it will come crashing to the ground. All of these arguments are related, of course. They are an appeal to that part of American society in which Judeo-Christian values are still deeply rooted. For even in America at the dawning of the 21st century, many people's understanding of morality and nature still reflect the vestiges of the Western Christendom of our heritage, as do their ideas of tradition, history and an ideal society.We do not, however, argue against civil same-sex marriage in the spirit of calm persuasion. There is desperation in our tone. There is also a great deal of fear and mean-spiritedness in our rhetoric, to the point where we even accuse homosexuals (without much proof, I might add) of being child molesters and sexual predators, and of seeking to corrupt our youth by recruiting them into their ""lifestyle.""There are probably many people who think they are justified in having such fears, but it seems to me it is more than just paranoia that feeds our frenzy.

"This post contains a perfectly simple explanation of why ToE is a sham along with a challenge to any Darwinist to prove me wrong.ToE is constructed on a fraud premise. This premise says that the fundamental unit of evolution is the gene. Whenever an evolutionist talks about “evolution” he's not talking about mere phenotypic change – he's talking about changes in genes. To a Darwinist, just because an animal changes phentoypically, or even if he passes these changes down to progeny does not mean that “evolution” has occurred. A fish could morph into a human, but if there are no changes in genes then this would not be considered ""evolution."" The only way evolution can happen, by their own definition, is if there is a change in genetics. This premise, I suggest is a complete and total fraud...and I will explain why now:Let's take humans and dogs, for example. When compared side-by-side, sure enough, humans may have an assortment of genes that dogs do not – and possibly the other way around. But just because humans may have certain genes that dogs don't, does not mean that these genes cause the difference between humans and dogs. Of course, there are no “dog genes” or “human genes.” But likewise there are no “tongue genes,” “tail genes” or “toenail genes.” Parts are not translated genes. Thus, the assertion that new genes got created or that individual genes mutated over time to chnage one kind of animal into another is blatantly false and physically impossible.But it's worse than that.As I said before, humans have a whole slew of genes – theoretically, at least -- that dogs (or other animals) don't have. But evolutionists still contend that these genetic differences cause the difference between the organisms! That's why they analyze DNA with such scrutiny! But did it ever dawn on them that studying genetics is a compete waste of time because of the real possibility that each dog or each human has the genes they have because of what they are? Scientists have been telling us for decades that who or what we are is determined by what genes we have...But they've got it backwards! Instead, we have the genes we have because of who we are. A dog isn't a dog because he barks; a dog barks because of what he is. Same with genes.This, of course, spells destructin to ToE because it means genetic evolution is a fraud. Evolution, thus, should not be a theory based on changes in genes, but a theory based on changes in traits.But scientists continue to mess around with genes and try to make the body do weird things by mutating them. They simply won't give up because they've seen correlations between gene activity and various physiological responses.But here's where they're screwing everything up:When you were a kid did you ever stand on your head? If so, did your face ever get red if you stayed upside down for a period of time? If so, do you admit that it was the act of being upside down that caused the blood to rush to your head? Or, do you have the audacity to claim that you were upside down because your face was red? That's excactly what science is doing with genetics: they've got the audacity to claim that changes in genes (the red face) is causing the organsim to change physiologically (go upside down.) In reality, what's happening is the organism is experiencing a new environment (turning upside down) and then the genes are responding in kind (turning red).The only way you can prove this logic wrong is to do one of two things:1) show me conclusively that mutations happen completely randomly and unoriented to environmental pressures. 2) show me that the same environmental pressures on genes will not produce the exact same physiological effects over and over and over.So there it is. Go for it.",So what this guy is saying is that he believes in natural selection but not evolution?,notsarc

So limiting the capacity would probably have less of an effect on the ability to defend yourself than on crime. So why are people from the gun lobby always whining about restrictions like this?

That means, in principle, IC systems can evolve. If you don't believe so, bring forth the I.C. system of your choice.   To say 'But you don't know all the answers' is just the logical fallacy known as 'argument from ignorance'.

"You are so right-on in what you say!In a Sunday school at a church I formerly attended, an elder of the church remarked that his ""faith was strengthened"" by the ""evidence"" afforded by recent archaeological discoveries in the middle east. In a tone I now rather regret, I blurted out two things......How weak was your faith before?and...If the ""evidence"" had gone 'the other way,' would your faith then have been weakened?His answer for the second question was a simple 'no,' which suggests to me that the sense of the term 'evidence' he was employing was not the same sense you'd expect a scientist to use.His response to the first was problematic, and interesting. ""My faith,"" he said, has always been--then he used the most interesting word--""complete."" But he had taken sufficient offence already, it seemed, that I pressed no further. I wish sometimes that I'd asked: If your faith was ""always complete,"" did the archaeological evidence make it ""more complete""? And, if so, does your sense of 'complete' match that word's usual application?I do not quite grasp the notion of there being ""scientific evidence"" for a proposition within the realm of faith. I do not mean to suggest that my claim that scientific and religious propositions reside in different discourses disposes of all worry or complaint. Activity in one realm may be felt in the other.But, re: evolution, I think this...Given convincing evidence that, say, the earth is billions of years old, not thousands--a mound of evidence more than high enough for my needs--my worry is not that the 'Biblical account' of creation is wrong, erroneous, falsified...but rather is the quite different worry of wondering what, now, that account's meaning is, what it affirms. Scientific discovery, evidence, and discourse thus don't ""disprove the Bible."" Rather, they serve to displace interpretations of biblical text, and give us cause--I call it: opportunity--to find new, richer meaning in scripture. I'm often embarrassed by the smallness and brittleness of certain Christians' interpretations. Emphasizing the 'literal,' as some do--a very problematic term in itself--some Christians see in, for example, the Genesis ""tree of the knowledge of good and evil"" nothing more than a tree. A biological tree. Pear tree. Peach tree. Apple tree. Tree of the knowledge of good and evil. Albeit a special species, nonetheless a species. And, for them, there you go--Eve chowed down on the fruit of a proscribed species, and that's your story. Lost, in the insistence upon and closing of that interpretation, is the richness of metaphor the story offers. Metaphor, again and again, is variously deliberately denigrated or unconsciously eclipsed, in the readings of certain Christians.Science is not the only victim of such cheesily 'literal' interpretation. Christian faith--at least, the possibility of a rich faith robustly aware of its own weight in metaphor, parable, legend and myth, and the transformative power that arises from those aspects of scripture--is equally victim. I feel more sadness about such a limited believer's faith than I do about that person's science.Master_Shake, for your poignantly apt remark--""what they have isn't faith at all""--thanks.

What astounds me is that those who favor abortion went through an identical development stage as the being they are condemning to death.

Abortion today is used primarily as a birth control of convenience because people are too self-centered to take precautions. They prefer their own pleasurable self-indulgence over the care and sanctity of the life they created. What ever happened to taking responsibility for one's actions in this country? Is it too much to ask a woman who has conceived to place the child into adoption? Nine months of discomfort is nothing compared to life in prison for voluntary manslaughter! Does the father of the child have a say in this? And what about the constitution of the United States? Are not all people conceived in this country deserving of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness? I believe abortion is a crime against humanity and should be outlawed.

"Read these storys of self defence and then tell me Brady how you can justify theseThe injustice of the British ban on self defenseMaking matters worse, the British legal system seems to treat crime victims worse than it treats the criminals who attacked them. An example is the Tony Martin case:Tony Martin was a farmer, whose remote farmhouse had been broken in to many times. Martin feared future burglary attempts and the risk of being attacked by a violent burglar. When a pair of burglars broke in while he was home, Martin opened fire with a pump action shotgun. The 16-year-old burglar Fred Barras was killed, and 33-year-old Brendon Fearon was wounded in the leg. Later on that day, the police arrested Tony Martin and charged him with the crimes of murder and wounding with intent. At trial, Martin argued that he had acted in self defense, but the court found that he had fired while they were trying to flee. He was convicted of murder and sentenced to life in prison, although the conviction was later reduced to manslaughter with a 5 year sentence. The surviving criminal, who had over 30 criminal convictions, then sued Tony Martin for the injury he suffered during the burglary. The parole board refused to grant Tony Martin an early release because he “has shown no remorse and would continue to pose a danger to any other burglars.” Martin was eventually released from prison after spending years in prison and being vilified by the anti-gun groups in the UK for shooting criminals who had broken into his home.Another example, from 2009, also shows how the British legal system favors criminals over their victims:A millionaire businessman has been jailed for attacking a man who held his family hostage in their own home – while the criminal went free. Munir Hussain, who was threatened at knifepoint and tied up by a gang of masked men in his living room last year, was told he must go to prison for 30 months to preserve “civilised society”. But Walid Salem, a criminal with more than 50 convictions, was handed a two-year supervision order for his role in the break-in at an earlier hearing. He was one of three men who ambushed Mr Hussain, his wife and children as they returned to their home in High Wycombe, Bucks, on Sept 3 last year after attending Ramadan prayers at their local mosque, Reading Crown Court heard. Their hands were tied behind their backs and they were forced to crawl from room to room before being forced to lie down in the living room. But when Hussain's teenage son managed to escape and raise the alarm, he seized his chance and turned on his captors. . . The brothers were found guilty of causing grievous bodily harm with intent by a jury in September. Sentencing, Judge John Reddihough told them it was his “public duty” to jailing Munir Hussain for 30 months and his brother for 39 months.This one is quite nice as wellCleared: Builder who chopped off thug's ear with Samurai sword after he threatened to rape and kill his family | Mail OnlineWell thank god for the gun ban in england.

The human immune system DRB1 genes are extremely polymorphic, with gene lineages that coalesce into an ancestor who lived around 60 million years ago, a time before the divergence of the apes from the Old World monkeys. The theory of gene coalescence suggests that, throughout the last 60 million years, human ancestral populations had an effective size of 100,000 individuals or greater. Molecular evolution data favor the African origin of modern humans, but the weight of the evidence is against a population bottleneck before their emergence.

Look around. Faith did not spontaneously generate out of thin air. It is obviously part of our psyche. Every civilization throughout history has felt the need for some type of faith. Even on different sides of the planet.It's as natural as the sun rising.,"But what about the hypothetical?I can't think of a single child on this planet that has never been exposed to the ideas of the supernatural.So, what I was asking is whether faith is nature or nurture.That's why I brought up kids being afraid of the dark, likely no matter what anyone tells them. I think it's this fear of the unknown linked to the ""logical"" brain of a human that possibly creates this need for explanations. But faith involves specifics, so when the specifics are filled in and ""make sense"" to more than one person, these specific ""explanations"" can be passed down.So I don't know how much of faith is nature and how much is nurture.",notsarc

"Fundamental RightsThis relationship of citizen and state is fundamental to democracy. In the words of the U.S. Declaration of Independence, written by Thomas Jefferson in 1776:We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights, that among these are life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. That to secure these rights, governments are instituted among men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed.More specifically, in democracies, these fundamental or inalienable rights include freedom of speech and expression, freedom of religion and conscience, freedom of assembly, and the right to equal protection before the law. This is by no means an exhaustive list of the rights that citizens enjoy in a democracy, but it does constitute a set of the irreducible core rights that any democratic government worthy of the name must uphold. Since they exist independently of government, in Jefferson's view, these rights cannot be legislated away, nor should they be subject to the whim of an electoral majority.",And here our Government recognizes:  Rule of Law: Fundamental Rights of Citizens Democracies exist to serve their people,notsarc
