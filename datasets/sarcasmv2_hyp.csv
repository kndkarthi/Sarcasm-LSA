"umm... i think the infringement of gay rights is kinda what we're discussing here, bucko. what rights of yours are being infringed by not infringing the rights of gays? if you can't answer, maybe you should deal with that.","wait so being bullied is infringing on your rights? well no duh but if i 'bucko' have to deal with it on a daily basis just for the fact that i'm slightly different i'm not surprised someone has to deal with it for their sexuality. and if they just dealt with the fact they were gay, accepted it and realized that other people aren't the end all and be all, that they'd eventually find people who accepted them for who they were and that high school wasn't the world maybe they'd still be alive.",sarc
let's just cut to the chase on your spurious claim. when was the xivth amendment passed.? here is the enforcement provisions of the act of 1964: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/civil_rights_act_of_1964 heller ruled that the 2a was about more than 'discrimination on gun laws' in that as long as the 'discrimination was equal it would be legal according to the plaintiffs and muncipalities'. that was ruled out and dismissed by scotus. you are building a strawman trying to imply i said your words. you are a poor liar. ad absurdum!,"1868 actually, that is a link to the wikipedia article on the act. once again, the 14th amendment and the civil rights act of 1964 are not the same thing. more importantly, a store saying 'no blacks allowed' is not violating the 14th, they violate the civil rights act of 1964. furthermore, a store saying 'no guns allowed' is not violated the 2nd amendment.  time for you to read up on the constitution doc, you might find some good things in there. i'm a little surprised you don't vote democrat given your thoughts. then again, not much difference between a given democrat and your texas 'republicans' (see w bush and rick perry)",sarc
