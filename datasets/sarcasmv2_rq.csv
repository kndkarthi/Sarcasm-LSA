"i did say that if birth control failed (condoms do sometimes too, i think their effectiveness is at like 97%, but that's not 100%) abortion should be acceptable. i know some people want to ban the morning-after pill, but i think most people agree that it should be ok, i know i do. the day of conception, there is virtually no argument that the fetus is actually a human life that takes priority over the mother's life, unless they get into a purely religious rant about how the moment of conception the fetus is a human life that deserves the same rights as anyone. anyway, i don't agree with that.","could you clarify the italicized sentence for me, please? i don't understand if you are saying that the fetus takes priority or not. if so, why?thanks...monday morning fogginess.",notsarc
"penfold, now it is only 'certain' behaviours which are 'inherently' evil across all cultures and mores.  isn't it interesting how these absolutists backpeadl so rapidly when challenged. i just hope they don't fall over backward in their retreat. no, i take that back. i do hope they fall over backward.emoticonxangry","backpedaling? how's that? my original answer is that it's wrong to force children to have sex with old men. that is my answer still. where has it changed? in fact, each post i've made is an affirmation of the one before it. how is that backpedaling? there are absolute goods and evils. that is, there are certain things that are good or bad. how is that saying something different? certain things are bad. period. just like certain things are wrong, no matter how many people think that they aren't wrong. period. is that clear enough for you? i hope so because that's what i've been saying all along and you'd have to be high to think i've changed my position.",notsarc
"i said a few posts up that i don't think that people are actually offended. it's strictly a seperation of church and state issue. incorrect. check out my post above from 7-19 to see the legal issues. in particular, the government may not take any action whos primary effect is to advance or endorse religion and 'the constitution forbids not only state practices that 'aid one religion...or prefer one religion over another,' but also those practices that 'aid all religions' and thus endorse or prefer religion over nonreligion'.","you guys just don't get it do you? this isn't about an attack on christianity. this isn't about anti-christians, and in the end, this isn't about the cross, or any other religious symbol for that matter, offending anyone. this is about keeping religion from meddling with government, but just as, if not more, important, it is about keeping government from meddling with religion, and the moment they intertwine, there are possibilities for many dangerous things to happen. and by the way, i'm a christian, and i don't want my government in any way defining any part of what i hold dear. p.s. sandycane- most buddhists aren't in india.",notsarc

How can you possibly equate prostitution to gay marriage? And would society break down if some individuals are allowed to enter into a legally protecting penumbra institution we call marriage?

"As do you. You seriously want to dictate to others that your opinions are the truth. I'm sure you find a lot of things amusing, given your warped view on things. Actually I think that what a lot of the 55-60% of the country who oppose gay marriage find, is that if they join an internet site, that they will be viciously attacked by gay marriage supporters. That's what most of you are REALLY LIKE.  There really isn't much of an anti-gay movement, except a handful of people and a few commercials. Your vilification of them is typical of most far left gay marriage supporters.","Actually, what gay marriage proponents simply want is to be treated like every one else. Denying the right to marriage because of his/her sexual orientation makes them second class citizens. The supporters of the anti-gay movement simply want to impose their moral values on to the rest of the public, the recent prop 8 ballot initiative proves it. Ever read John Locke or JS Mill? You should, it's what our country ideals are based on. You have your bubble and I have mine so just leave me alone; and the majority are never always right and should not have a say in what is moral or just based on their beliefs.",notsarc

only if the question is from whence did you get your prejudices?,"1) i dont recall saying anything that i believed 2) someones experiences should definitly be looked at you are just one rude person. i was just sharing an experience my mom had teaching. not only that, youe are comparing a pedophiliac to a gay man adopting. what does this prove? i never said all striaight families are perfect and i never said all gay families are bad either. all i stated was one persons direct observations on the situation. how many child of gay couples have you taught? observed? 30 years worth? i believe i will take someones experience over you being rude.",notsarc
"which is why it should be done on a case-by-case basis. sometimes there can be an age gap of 5 years and it could still be consensual, so imo fine, but other times it could be 4 years age difference and not fine (eg, a 14 year old and a ten year old) i'm not really sure how that analogy is relevant. -wez",your right about the 14 year old and the ten year old but if it is a 18 and 14 should that be legal? or 18 and 15? 16 and 21 is legal (although it is wrong) because the youngest one is still legal. age of consent = 16 years old. if your basing it on a year gap what about 10 years? i am 10 years older than my fiance. before anyone jumps to conclusions i am 38. and she is 28. legal? why? we are both over 16.......period.,notsarc
"personally i don't give rats rear end about your god - neither he, you, the government or the ignoramous in rome will ever have say in what happens to this body. yes there are - and as long as you continue to trivialize and disregard them you will not to a damned thing to reduce abortion.","have you ever considered the possibility that he cares about you? that he knows you? and that he cares about those in the womb? this is always the charge hurled at me but it is never founded. you cannot find any misogyny in my writings but rather a great respect for women and their value and dignity. this is why i argue so strongly against abortion. yet, any oppression, or insecurity, or hardship, or difficulty they face, though real and challenging, is not justified in the face of destroying the life in the womb. though abortion reigns freely and forcefully and abundantly still the oppression and abuse of women endure. one reason they endure is that people are looking in the wrong place for a solution--they are looking to abortion when it offers no solution.",notsarc
